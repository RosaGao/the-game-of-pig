Built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

The game of Pig is a simple dice game where two players race to reach 100 points. On each turn, the current player repeatedly rolls a die until a "1" is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

    1. If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing, and it becomes the next player's turn.
    2. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total, and the player's turn continues.
    3. If a player chooses to "hold," their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

This game is part of a family of games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games" because the main challenge is "whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potentially greater gains."
